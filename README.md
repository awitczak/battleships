# Battleships
The aim for this project is to create a battleship game held in terminal 
with the ability to deploy ships and play against basic AI.

The main goal is to firstly accomplish a working singleplayer version of the game and then 
work on a multiplayer version, so that 2 people can download it and play against themselves.

It is important to note that this project is a part of the course I have from C++ during my 3rd year 
on AGH University of Science and Technology and our group consists of me and two friends.
However, the code I share here is written and developed by me and I will add the whole project
to a folder inside this branch.
